# Notes about this testing file
1. You CAN use it, however, much of it has been depreciated and is not useable anymore, or has been redacted
2. I am keeping it here, incase you want to add onto the project. I found it useful when I added onto this project, however that code belongs to the BCDC unfortunately.
3. If you are running into an issue that this testing directory does not catch, email me and ill see if I can get you more testing files(many are not my own intellectual property anymore:( )
